            <h1>Garrett's Assignment 3 - Manipulating input/output photoresistor!</h1>
            <p>
                    <h2>Schematic</h2>
                        <p>Key parts of the schematic include: green LED and 330 ohm resistor connected to pin 11, photoresistor and 10k ohm resistor connected to input Analog 0.</p>

                    <h3>Calculations</h3>
                        <p>In order to prevent the circuit from shorting and breaking pieces, I calculated resistance values. Using Ohm's law to calculate the resistance values, I calculated the required minimum resistance of the green LED and the photoresistor. I assumed minimum current usage of LED's to be 0.02mA and photoresistor 200mA. Thus, calculated a minimum resistor value for green LED as 160 ohms and photoresistor, a minimum of 25 ohms. I used a 330 ohm resistor for LED and 10k ohm resistor for photoresistor, to ensure nothing breaks. Specific calculations are below: </p>

                    <h2>Circuit</h2>
                        <p>The circuit's green LED is turned off whenever the photoresistor reads a value greater than 100. When the photoresistor reads a value not greater than 100, the LED will turn on based on an analogWrite value mapped to output value.</p>

                    <h2>Firmware</h2>
                         <p>The general logic of this code initializes an input pin to analog 0, an output value mapping the sensor reading value, and an LEDpin to pin 11. The base light value in my room is around 110. Thus, using an if-statement to check if the light value is greater than 100, the light value will be turned off. When a light value that is not greater than 100 is read, the LED will turn on based on an analog mapped value.
