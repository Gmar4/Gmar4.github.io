                        <p>The circuit repeats a fading red LED. When the button is pushed, the red LED will turn off and the RGB LED will turn on with red, green, and blue color values.</p>

                    <h2>Firmware</h2>
                         <p>The general logic of this code initializes a timer to each specific pin and LED to blink on and off.
